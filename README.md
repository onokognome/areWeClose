Problem solution for Shoreline Software's Software Engineer (Languages) postion.

Here's what is being asked: 
  We are building a social network.  In this social network, each user has friends.
  A chain of friends between two users, user A and user B, is a sequence of users starting with A and ending with B, such that each pair of consecutive users in the chain are friends.
  Given a social network and two users, user A and user B, please write a function that computes the length of the shortest chain of friends between A and B.
  
Please write answers to the following discussion questions and include them in your solution as comments:

How did you represent the social network?  Why did you choose this representation?
What algorithm did you use to compute the shortest chain of friends?  What alternatives did you consider?  Why did you choose this algorithm over the alternatives?
Please enumerate the test cases you considered and explain their relevance.

We will evaluate your solution and test suite for correctness, simplicity, clarity, and robustness.
